# WIP GTK4 bindings (with example file).

Hello, this what I have been up to for the last month. This is unfinished btw but it works.

Todo:
 * "Bind" more gui functions for all GUI components
 * Fix closing the app
 * fix the event handler and make it more flexible.

Help me please:
  * How to type cast in CSpydr (lol)
