# `csp-lint` - The CSpydr Code Linter

</div>

This folder contains the source code of `csp-lint`, the code linter for the CSpydr programming language.

This program is a small utility for error-checking CSpydr programs without running the actual compiler. It also features a **live mode**, which checks a program and all of its files for errors automatically.

## Installation

`csp-lint` will be installed as a part of CSpydr. View [INSTALL.md](../../INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.

## Usage

Linting a CSpydr application once can be done using:

```console
$ csp-lint <your cspydr file>
```

To enable the live mode, use the `-l` or `--live` flags. It enables you to keep `csp-lint` running in a separate terminal to get live error messages as you type the code. No need for constant recompiling.

```console
$ csp-lint <your cspydr file> --live
```

If your standard library path is **not** `/usr/share/cspydr/std`, set the corresponding path with the `-p` or `--std-path` flag.

To use `csp-lint` in a shell script or other form of program, you can use the `-v` or `--verbose` flags for program-friendlier error output.
